LyX layout files for [tuddesign](http://exp1.fkp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de/tuddesign/).

I'm not the author, but couldn't find the origial source today so I thought it would be a good idea to back these up on github.

Copy these files into you LyX `layouts` folder (e.g. in your [user directory](http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/UserDir)), reconfigure LyX (Tools -> Reconfigure) and restart it.
