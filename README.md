LyX layout files for [tuddesign](http://exp1.fkp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de/tuddesign/).

I'm not the author, but as I couldn't find the origial source I thought it would be a good idea to back these up here on github.

### Installation

You must have the `tuddesign` (classes and fonts) set up, see the above link.

Copy the layouts files from the `layouts` folder into your LyX `layouts` folder (e.g. in your [user directory](http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/UserDir)), then reconfigure LyX (Tools -> Reconfigure) and restart it. You should now be able to select the Document Class under Document -> Settings...
